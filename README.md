# Single-Cycle Adaptive Header Auto-Detection and Error Correction Core

   

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that makes it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs fabricated on a real chip. To learn more and get started, visit [https://tinytapeout.com](https://tinytapeout.com).

## Project Description

This project implements a **single-cycle adaptive header auto-detection and error correction core** for modern communication protocols. It uses:

- A **header generator** that produces a 32-bit sequence from a 5-bit preamble using XOR feedback shift register logic.
- A **32-bit comparator module** with error detection providing 2-bit output code for matching status.
  
The design is intended for robust detection and correction of protocol headers in digital communication systems.

## Project Structure

- Verilog source files are located in the `src` directory.
- The main modules are `header_gen` and `cmp32`.
- Testbench is available under `test/` using Verilog and also adapted for Cocotb Python tests for flexible simulation.

## How to Set Up and Run

1. Add Verilog source files to the `src/` folder if you modify or add modules.
2. Confirm or update the `top_module` and `source_files` fields in `info.yaml` to point to your files and top module.
3. Edit documentation in `docs/info.md` to explain your design clearly.
4. Use the provided testbench or Cocotb test scripts located in the `test/` folder for simulation.
5. The GitHub Actions workflow will run OpenLane to build ASIC files automatically.

## Running the Testbench

- Use the Verilog testbench `auto_tb.v` to simulate your design with ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or any compatible simulator.
- Alternatively, run python-based Cocotb tests with:

  ```bash
  make sim
  ```

  (Ensure Python cocotb and dependencies are installed.)
